## Thorny Hungry Hauto

This is a 2D game prototype developed in Unity, following a Udemy course.

### Basic Game Functionality

- **Player Controls:**
	- Use W/S keys to move forward/backward and A/D keys to steer left/right.
	- The player controls a vehicle that can navigate a 2D environment.

- **Speed Boosts:**
	- Driving over objects tagged as `SpeedBoost` temporarily increases the vehicle's speed and displays a boost notification.

- **Package Delivery System:**
	- The player can pick up packages by colliding with objects tagged as `Package` (if not already carrying one).
	- When carrying a package, colliding with a `Customer` delivers the package.
	- Visual and particle effects indicate package pickup and delivery.

- **Objective:**
	- Pick up packages and deliver them to customers as efficiently as possible.
